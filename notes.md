# Styling a webpage

* Margin
  - auto
* width
  - 100% -- 100 percent of the parent element it is inside
* float
    - left
    - right

* Put position relative for parent element
* Put position absolute for child

* Can then position using top,left etc at 50% for centre of div
  - Then use margin-left|top: - width/2|height/2

## 15/9/2020 Plan to flesh out project

* More info on Ipad
* Looking to create an ML section to analyse the race data, maybe some more classical statistical investigation
* Fix up data processing side which is looking like  bit of a bitch

Either a predictor to determine the lap time of a driver around a track and which features effect that.. ie how much does new tyres lead to better times

predictor to determine the final position of that driver

maybe to determine the effect of new tyres vs fuel level on lap times? too many variables maybe with tyre wear/strategy/management.. need to determine if drivers push for x amount of laps after new tyres, how that is affected with different tyre compounds

LOOK ON ml_experiment.md for final mission details
